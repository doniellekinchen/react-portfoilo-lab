    "bio": "Iâ€™m a passionate coder, who is currently learning more in a software engineering bootcamp, with a journey that began in my childhood when MySpace was popular. I loved the thrill of bringing my creative ideas to life on the screen through coding. Over the years, I've honed my skills in HTML and CSS and I'm currently on a mission to master JavaScript. Throughout my career, I've demonstrated unwavering persistence, always giving myself the grace to learn and grow. Some of my small projects include building a calculator and an analog clock on the computer before I fully understood JavaScript. Before I made the transition, I took a leap of faith and moved to South Korea in 2020. Within my 2nd year there, I helped start a school being their only foreign teacher and guided students from scratch in learning English. This experience showcased my dedication and hardworking nature not just to my job, but to learning in life. I will continue to grow through my personal experiences and through my career and hope to only elevate and learn."
