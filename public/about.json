    "bio": "Hello, my name is Donielle Kinchen. I am an ESL Teacher transitioning into a Full-Stack Developer. I improved my skills by completing a Software Engineering Immersive with General Assembly in January 2024. I enjoy bringing my creative ideas to life on the screen through coding, but I also wanted to learn how it's created under the hood. Throughout my career in both teaching and learning through GA, I've demonstrated unwavering persistence, always giving myself the grace to learn and grow. Before I made the full transition, I took a leap of faith and moved to South Korea in 2020. Within my 2nd year there, I helped start a school by being their only foreign teacher and guided students from scratch in learning English. This experience showcased my dedication and hardworking nature not just to my job, but to learning in life. I will continue to grow through my personal experiences and through my career and hope to only elevate and learn."
